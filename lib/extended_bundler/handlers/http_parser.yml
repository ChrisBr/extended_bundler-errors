      You need to install developer tools for your system.

      One of the following commands may help:

      Ubuntu:
       - `apt-get install build-essential`
       - `apt-get install libgmp-dev`

      Mac:
       - `xcode-select --install`
       - `brew uninstall gmp` and `brew install gmp`
